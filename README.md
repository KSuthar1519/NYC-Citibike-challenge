# NYC-Citibike-challenge
## Overview 
### The purpose of this analysis is to present an easy-to-follow way of understanding data involved in a bike-sharing business to ultimately provide a convincing business pitch.
The data used is publicly available and presents the bikesharing activity in New York City from August,2019. The data is used to pitch a business plan for the same service in Des Moines which means caution is advised while comparing data and predicting for a different city. 
Below is the image where firstly the column for tripduration is changed to a DateTime format:

##Summary

* Looking at the first image, it can be seen that vast majority of rides were under one hour in duration. The number of bikes checked out after 33 minutes of tripduration dropped distinctly.
* The tripduration had no seemingly distinct variation between genders - most trips peaked around 5 minutes for both genders. However notably the service is used more by males than females across the dataset. 
*The heat map shows morning around 8am and evenings around 5pm to be the peak hours where most numbers of bikes are checked out. Thursday evening to be the busiest hours- which also does not deviate for the genders male and female.
Subscribers to the service seem to be using the service more for commutes during peak traffic hours during weekdays. Single use customers seem to be using the services slightly more during the weekends than weekdays. 

For future, visualizations to analyze by birthyear to see if age had a impact on how the service is being used can be important to see who the target customer and age range will be. Also there should be analysis done to see how far in distance are most trips to plan stations in the new city for the service.
